  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are confronted with two fundamental challenges: (a) the uncertainty associated with decoding noisy brain signals, and (b) the need for co-adaptation between the brain and the interface so as to cooperatively achieve a common goal in a task. We seek to mitigate these challenges.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: We introduce a new approach to brain-computer interfacing based on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). POMDPs provide a principled approach to handling uncertainty and achieving co-adaptation in the following manner: (1) Bayesian inference is used to compute posterior probability distributions ('beliefs') over brain and environment state, and (2) actions are selected based on entire belief distributions in order to maximize total expected reward; by employing methods from reinforcement learning, the POMDP's reward function can be updated over time to allow for co-adaptive behaviour.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: We illustrate our approach using a simple non-invasive BCI which optimizes the speed-accuracy trade-off for individual subjects based on the signal-to-noise characteristics of their brain signals. We additionally demonstrate that the POMDP BCI can automatically detect changes in the user's control strategy and can co-adaptively switch control strategies on-the-fly to maximize expected reward.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the framework of POMDPs offers a promising approach for designing BCIs that can handle uncertainty in neural signals and co-adapt with the user on an ongoing basis. The fact that the POMDP BCI maintains a probability distribution over the user's brain state allows a much more powerful form of decision making than traditional BCI approaches, which have typically been based on the output of classifiers or regression techniques. Furthermore, the co-adaptation of the system allows the BCI to make online improvements to its behaviour, adjusting itself automatically to the user's changing circumstances.},

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. When presenting a stereo sound over a pair of transducers on a bone conduction headphone, the sound wave coming from either the left or right side transducer is delivered directly to the cochlea in both ears. This mechanism is often referred to as 'cross-talk,' and it may decrease the ability to sense sound direction perceived through the bone conduction headphone. In this paper, we investigate the application of active control technique on a bone conduction headphone for estimating a cross-talk compensation filter. To reduce perceived loudness in one of the ears, transfer functions on routes from transducers to a cochlea are estimated by using a microphone placed in the outer ear canal under the assumption that otoacoustic emission (OAE) emitted by the cochlea in response to a bone-conducted sound stimulus can be recorded. By using the transfer functions, the compensation filter which produces anti-sound can be obtained as a result of the filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm. In this study, sound stimuli with and without cancellation were presented through a bone conduction headphone where three subjects with normal hearing participated in the measurement. Experimental results show that sound reduction was achieved at the location of the microphone and all participants also reported that they could feel a decrease in the perceived loudness.},

While scene-driven visual navigation has been widely studied, prior efforts on learning navigation policies for robots to find objects are limited. The problem is often more challenging than target scene finding as the target objects can be very small in the view and can be in an arbitrary pose. We approach the problem from an active perceiver perspective, and propose a novel framework that integrates a deep neural network based object recognition module and a deep reinforcement learning based action prediction mechanism. To validate our method, we conduct experiments on both a simulation dataset (AI2-THOR) and a real-world environment with a physical robot. We further propose a new decaying reward function to learn the control policy specific to the object searching task. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our method, which outperforms competing methods in both average trajectory length and success rate.},

This paper presents a complete solution to manage the basic functions of a smartphone and to guide users using a wayfinding application. This way, a blind user could go to work from his home in an autonomous way using an adaptable wayfinding application on his smartphone. The wayfinding application combines text, map, auditory and tactile feedback for providing the information. Eighteen visually impaired users tested the application. Preliminary results from this study show that blind people and limited vision users can effectively use the wayfinding application without help. The evaluation also confirms the usefulness of extending the vibration feedback to convey distance information as well as directional information.

As BMI systems begin transitioning from laboratory settings into activities of daily living, an important goal is to develop neural decoding algorithms that can be calibrated with a minimal burden on the user, provide stable control for long periods of time, and can be responsive to fluctuations in the decoder's neural input space (e.g. neurons appearing or being lost amongst electrode recordings). These are significant challenges for static neural decoding algorithms that assume stationary input/output relationships. Here we use an actor-critic reinforcement learning architecture to provide an adaptive BMI controller that can successfully adapt to dramatic neural reorganizations, can maintain its performance over long time periods, and which does not require the user to produce specific kinetic or kinematic activities to calibrate the BMI. Two marmoset monkeys used the Reinforcement Learning BMI (RLBMI) to successfully control a robotic arm during a two-target reaching task. The RLBMI was initialized using random initial conditions, and it quickly learned to control the robot from brain states using only a binary evaluative feedback regarding whether previously chosen robot actions were good or bad. The RLBMI was able to maintain control over the system throughout sessions spanning multiple weeks. Furthermore, the RLBMI was able to quickly adapt and maintain control of the robot despite dramatic perturbations to the neural inputs, including a series of tests in which the neuron input space was deliberately halved or doubled.},

The distance from the virtual white cane to the reflection is computed through active triangulation.

In this way, the users receive information that could prevent collisions with obstacles in the environment. Our contributions include the development of a virtual white cane around a Smartphone and other off-the-shelf accessories and a methodology to provide personalized vibratory feedback to the user.

It exploits the inbuilt functionalities of the Unity engine in the Tango SDK to create a 3-D reconstruction of the surrounding environment, then associates a Unity collider component with the user and utilizes it to determine his interaction with the reconstructed mesh in order to detect obstacles.

  abstract  = {Background Older people generally prefer to continue living in their own homes rather than move into residential age care institutions. Assistive technologies and sensors in the home environment and/or bodily worn systems that monitor people's movement might contribute to an increased sense of safety and security at home. However, their use can raise ethical anxieties as little is known about how older persons perceive assistive and monitoring technologies. Objectives To review the main barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies (ATs) by older adults in order to uncover issues of concern from empirical studies and to arrange these issues from the most critical to the least critical. Method A 4-step systematic review was conducted using empirical studies: locating and identifying relevant articles; screening of located articles; examination of full text articles for inclusion/exclusion; and detail examination of the 44 articles included. Results Privacy is a top critical concern to older adults, registering a 34{\%} of the total articles examined. Two other equally potent barriers to the adoption of ATs were trust and functionality/added value representing 27 and 25 per cent each respectively of the total studies examined. Also of serious concerns are cost of ATs and ease of use and suitability for daily use (23{\%}) each respectively, perception of “no need” (20{\%}), stigma (18{\%}), and fear of dependence and lack of training (16{\%}) each respectively. These underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies such as the so-called “gerontechnologies” specifically targeting older adults. However, more and more older adults adopt different kinds of ATs in order to fit in with the society. Conclusions The identified underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies. The negative attitudes that are most frequently associated with technologies such as the so-called “gerontechnologies” specifically targeting older adults contain stigmatizing symbolism that might prevent them from adopting them.},

  abstract  = {Locomotion is inevitable for human beings. The main problem for visually challenged is movement from one place to another, level crossing and identification of their current location. In case of their venture into unfamiliar environment it is a menace for them and for their fellow mates too. Therefore it is essential for the family members, organization of visually challenged to know the current location of the visually challenged. Smart walking cane acts an Electronic Travel Aid (ETA). Smart walking cane solves the challenge by detecting both indoor and outdoor obstacles and by providing level crossing guidance and current position of the visually challenged. Obstacles are detected using Ultrasonic sensors; Global Positioning System (GPS) is used to indicate the current location of the visually challenged; level crossing guidance is provided by Reflective Infra Red (RIR) sensor. The current position of visually challenged is uploaded to cloud through Wi-Fi module. Navigation information and instructions is intimated to the user of the Smart walking cane by text-to-speech converter through stereophonic Headphone. Buzzer and Vibratory circuit assists to find the distance in noisy environment too. This Smart walking cane meets the mandatory requirements of the blind people to navigate as well as to know the position and orientation of the visually challenged. {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. In the most recent report published by theWorld Health Organization concerning people with visual disabilities it is highlighted that by the year 2020, worldwide, the number of completely blind people will reach 75 million, while the number of visually impaired (VI) people will rise to 250 million. Within this context, the development of dedicated electronic travel aid (ETA) systems, able to increase the safe displacement of VI people in indoor/outdoor spaces, while providing additional cognition of the environment becomes of outmost importance. This paper introduces a novel wearable assistive device designed to facilitate the autonomous navigation of blind and VI people in highly dynamic urban scenes. The system exploits two independent sources of information: ultrasonic sensors and the video camera embedded in a regular smartphone. The underlying methodology exploits computer vision and machine learning techniques and makes it possible to identify accurately both static and highly dynamic objects existent in a scene, regardless on their location, size or shape. In addition, the proposed system is able to acquire information about the environment, semantically interpret it and alert users about possible dangerous situations through acoustic feedback. To determine the performance of the proposed methodology we have performed an extensive objective and subjective experimental evaluation with the help of 21 VI subjects from two blind associations. The users pointed out that our prototype is highly helpful in increasing the mobility, while being friendly and easy to learn.},

Since local descriptors are robust to background clutter, occlusion and other content variations, they have been receiving more and more attention in the application of the detector-descriptor based visual odometry. To our knowledge, however, there is no extensive, comparative evaluation inves-tigating the performance of the detector-descriptor based methods in the sce-nario of monocular visual-IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) odometry. In this paper, we therefore perform such an evaluation under a unified framework. We select five typical routes from the challenging KITTI dataset by taking into account the length and shape of routes, the impact of independent motions due to other vehicles and pedestrians. In terms of the five routes, we conduct five different experiments in order to assess the performance of different combina-tions of salient point detector and local descriptor in various road scenes, respectively. The results obtained in this study potentially provide a series of guidelines for the selection of salient point detectors and local descriptors.},

The pressure needed to apply the transducer often gives the patient discomfort, and the attenuating effect of the skin gives poor electroacoustical function of the aid. A permanent skin penetration has made it possible to develop a bone-anchored hearing aid with all components in one housing. Ten patients have been equipped with such an aid. This paper deals with a comparative hearing threshold measurement on 10 patients. B{\'{e}}k{\'{e}}sy audiometry was performed and a conventional Oticon (A-type) transducer was used. In the frequency range 600 to 6 000 Hz, there was a lowering of 10-20 dB in thresholds when skin penetration was performed. This lowering in thresholds means lower transducer distortion, lower electrical gain, and lower power consumption to produce a given sensation level.},

This paper presents some of the results from an experiment conducted to investigate the interaction patterns and effectiveness of motion cues as a feedback modality between a human operator and a miniature robot in a confined collaborative navigation task. The results presented in this paper show evidence of human adaptation to the robot and moreover suggest that the adaptation rate is not constant or continuous in time but is discontinuous and nonlinear. The results also show evidence of a starting exploration stage before the adaptation with duration dependent on the expectations of the human regarding the capabilities of the robot in the given task. The paper investigates how to utilize these and related findings for building robots not only capable of adapting to human operators but can also help those operators adapt to them.},

The input into the bonephones necessary to reach a 71{\%} detection threshold is measured at critical band centers ranging from 150 Hz to 13500 Hz. These thresholds were measured with an open ear canal, a plugged ear canal, and a masking noise. Results were consistent with other bone-conduction threshold measurements.

This offers the descriptive and predictive power of SLAM systems which perform dense surface reconstruc- tion, but with a huge representation compression. The ob- ject graph enables predictions for accurate ICP-based cam- era to model tracking at each live frame, and efficient ac- tive search for new objects in currently undescribed image regions.

The device features complete voice assistance for easy navigation, through simple button clicks. It can also detect obstacles ahead up to three meters and can differentiate between objects and humans with guaranteed 80{\%} accuracy. Both vibratory and voice feedbacks are provided for accurate collision alerts. Indriya uses less number of sensors and extracts its smartness by incorporating Android and Internet of Things (IOT) support.

  abstract = {Blind or visually impaired people usually do not leave their homes without any assistance, in order to visit unknown cities or places. One reason for this dilemma is, that it is hardly possible for them to gain a non-visual overview about the new place, its landmarks and geographic entities already at home. Sighted people can use a printed or digital map to perform this task. Existing haptic and acoustic approaches today do not provide an economic way to mediate the understanding of a map and relations between objects like distance, direction, and object size. We are providing an interactive three-dimensional sonification interface to explore city maps. A blind person can build a mental model of an area's structure by virtually exploring an auditory map at home. Geographic objects and landmarks are presented by sound areas, which are placed within a sound room. Each type of object is associated with a different sound and can therefore be identified. By investigating the auditory map, the user perceives an idea of the various objects, their directions and relative distances. First user tests show, that users are able to reproduce a sonified city map, which comes close to the original visual city map. With our approach exploring a map with non-speech sound areas provide a new user interface metaphor that offers its potential not only for blind and visually impaired persons but also to applications for sighted persons.},

By using color detection technique our system can pinpoint a user's location with very high accuracy for real-time applications. We used our system to filter out an image for a specific color and extracted pixel co-ordinates for that image. User's location is then determined by comparing the matrix for those values against a pre-created matrix of training images. We successfully conducted experiments in indoor environments as well and they yielded very good results. After analyzing these results, we propose to integrate our localization system with indoor navigation systems which can be used for blind people where accuracy is the most important element.

Our dataset features 55 hours of video consisting of 11.5M frames, which we densely labeled for a total of 39.6K action segments and 454.3K object bounding boxes. Our annotation is unique in that we had the participants narrate their own videos (after recording), thus reflecting true intention, and we crowd-sourced ground-truths based on these.

Moreover, it explores whether the impact of this effect varies with two additional variables: 1) haptic wall stiffness and 2) visual cursor diameter. Finally, we discuss the relative dominance of visual and haptic cues during a targeting task. The results indicate that while the spatial discrepancies studied exerted a small effect on the time required to perform targeting, they impacted the absolute errors considerably. Additionally, we report that haptic wall stiffness has a significant effect on absolute errors while the visual cursor diameter has a significant effect on movement time. Finally, we conclude that while both visual and haptic cues are important during targeting tasks, haptic cues played a more dominant role than visual cues. The results of this paper can be used to predict how human targeting performance will vary between systems, such as those using haptically enabled virtual reality or augmented reality technologies that feature visual-haptic spatial discrepancies.},

In this paper, a new system for NAVI is presented based on visual and range information. Instead of using several sensors, we choose one device, a consumer RGB-D camera, and take advantage of both range and visual information. In particular, the main contribution is the combination of depth information with image intensities, resulting in the robust expansion of the range-based floor segmentation. On one hand, depth information, which is reliable but limited to a short range, is enhanced with the long-range visual information. On the other hand, the difficult and prone-to-error image processing is eased and improved with depth information. The proposed system detects and classifies the main structural elements of the scene providing the user with obstacle-free paths in order to navigate safely across unknown scenarios. The proposed system has been tested on a wide variety of scenarios and data sets, giving successful results and showing that the system is robust and works in challenging indoor environments.},

Our approach offers two main advantages over prior approaches from the literature and commercial software: the kinematic models are estimated for a specific individual without a priori assumptions on limb dimensions or range of motion, and our kinematic formalism explicitly encodes the natural kinematic constraints of the human body. The personalized models are tested in a human-robot collaborative manipulation experiment. We find that human subjects with a restricted range of motion rotate their torso significantly less during bimanual object handoffs if the robot uses a personalized kinematic model to plan the handoff configuration, as compared to previous approaches using generic human kinematic models.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has made a big impact in recent years by achieving human level game play in the Atari 2600 games just using images as input and by learning robot control policies end-to-end from images to motor signals - tasks, which were previously intractable for classical reinforcement learning. For learning these control policies based on deep neural networks policy search methods, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (Lillicrap et al., 2015) and especially trust region policy optimization (Schulman et al., 2015), have been very successful, also in transferring insights and past approaches of classical reinforcement learning to deep neural networks. In this thesis we build up this previous work and derive a new algorithm for deep neural networks, called compatible policy search (COPS), based on the idea of the natural gradient, compatible value function approximation, entropy regularization and relative entropy policy search (Peters et al., 2010). In our experiment we investigated the capability of COPS and other policy search methods in challenging partially observable environments: RockSample, where the agent needs to take information gathering into account and Pocman, a large scale partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) with ca. 10{\^{}}56 underlying states. We present results where COPS outperforms all other six policy search methods and where the additional entropy regularization constraint, bounding the entropy of the new policy, is essential for exploration and for finding a good policy in these partially observable environments. Furthermore, to encourage additional exploration in these partially observable environments we will propose a factored context tree switching model for POMDPs, which we use for a pseudocount based exploration bonus and leads to additional performance gains.},

Our stimulus was a drifting sinusoidal grating windowed in space by a stationary, two-dimensional, Gaussian envelope (sigma=1 cycle of sinusoid). Localization measures were made following either a short (200 ms) or long (4.2 s) post-stimulus delay. The visuomotor localization error was up to three times greater than the perceptual error for a short delay. However, the visuomotor and perceptual localization measures were similar for a long delay. Our results provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that separate cortical pathways exist for visual perception and visually guided action and that delayed actions rely on stored perceptual information.},

Past methods have failed to effectively measure these critical variables. Here, we introduce continuous pointing as a novel method with several advantages over previous methods. Participants point continuously to the mentally updated location of a previously viewed target during passive, full-body movement. High-precision motion-capture data of arm angle provide a measure of a participant's perceived location and, in turn, perceived velocity at every moment during a motion trajectory. In two experiments, linear movements were presented in the absence of vision by passively translating participants with a robotic wheelchair or an anthropomorphic robotic arm (MPI Motion Simulator). The movement profiles included constant-velocity trajectories, two successive movement intervals separated by a brief pause, and reversed-motion trajectories. Results indicate a steady decay in perceived velocity during constant-velocity travel and an attenuated response to mid-trial accelerations. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Numerous projects have investigated assistive navigation technologies for the blind community, tackling challenges ranging from interface design to sensory substitution. However, none of these have successfully integrated what we consider to be the three factors necessary for a widely deployable system that delivers a rich experience of one's environment: implementation on a commodity device, use of a pre-existing worldwide point of interest (POI) database, and a means of rendering the environment that is superior to a naive playback of spoken text. Our "In Situ Audio Services" (ISAS) application responds to these needs, allowing users to explore an urban area without necessarily having a particular destination in mind. We describe the technical aspects of its implementation, user requirements, interface design, safety concerns, POI data source issues, and further requirements to make the system practical on a wider basis. Initial qualitative feedback from blind users is also discussed.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM. Visual impairments encompass a range of visual abilities. People with low vision have functional vision and thus their experiences are likely to be different from people with no vision. We sought to answer two research questions: (1) what challenges do low vision people face when performing daily activities and (2) what AIDS (high- and low-tech) do low vision people use to alleviate these challenges? Our goal was to reveal gaps in current technologies that can be addressed by the UbiComp community. Using contextual inquiry, we observed 11 low vision people perform a wayfinding and shopping task in an unfamiliar environment. The task involved wayfinding and searching and purchasing a product. We found that, although there are low vision AIDS on the market, participants mostly used their smartphones, despite interface accessibility challenges. While smartphones helped them outdoors, participants were overwhelmed and frustrated when shopping in a store. We discuss the inadequacies of existing AIDS and highlight the need for systems that enhance visual information, rather than convert it to audio or tactile.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a real-time vision-based system to assist a person with dementia wash their hands. The system uses only video inputs, and assistance is given as either verbal or visual prompts, or through the enlistment of a human caregiver's help. The system combines a Bayesian sequential estimation framework for tracking hands and towel, with a decision-theoretic framework for computing policies of action. The decision making system is a partially observable Markov decision process, or POMDP. Decision policies dictating system actions are computed in the POMDP using a point-based approximate solution technique. The tracking and decision making systems are coupled using a heuristic method for temporally segmenting the input video stream based on the continuity of the belief state. A key element of the system is the ability to estimate and adapt to user psychological states, such as awareness and responsiveness. We evaluate the system in three ways. First, we evaluate the hand-tracking system by comparing its outputs to manual annotations and to a simple hand-detection method. Second, we test the POMDP solution methods in simulation, and show that our policies have higher expected return than five other heuristic methods. Third, we report results from a ten-week trial with seven persons moderate-to-severe dementia in a long-term care facility in Toronto, Canada. The subjects washed their hands once a day, with assistance given by our automated system, or by a human caregiver, in alternating two-week periods. We give two detailed case study analyses of the system working during trials, and then show agreement between the system and independent human raters of the same trials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Reading is one of the most well studied visual activities. Vision research traditionally focuses on understanding the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in reading. In this work we recognise reading activity by jointly analysing eye and head movements of people in an everyday environment. Eye movements are recorded using an electrooculography (EOG) system; body movements using body-worn inertial measurement units. We compare two approaches for continuous recognition of reading: String matching (STR) that explicitly models the characteristic horizontal saccades during reading, and a support vector machine (SVM) that relies on 90 eye movement features extracted from the eye movement data. We evaluate both methods in a study performed with eight participants reading while sitting at a desk, standing, walking indoors and outdoors, and riding a tram. We introduce a method to segment reading activity by exploiting the sensorimotor coordination of eye and head movements during reading. Using person-independent training, we obtain an average precision for recognising reading of 88.9$\backslash${\%} (recall 72.3$\backslash${\%}) using STR and of 87.7$\backslash${\%} (recall 87.9$\backslash${\%}) using SVM over all participants. We show that the proposed segmentation scheme improves the performance of recognising reading events by more than 24$\backslash${\%}. Our work demonstrates that the joint analysis of multiple modalities is beneﬁcial for reading recognition and opens up discussion on the wider applicability of this recognition approach to other visual and physical activities.},

Eight different headphones (including various in-ear, circumaural open and closed, and bone conduction headphones) were tested. In addition, the effect of headphone equalization (aiming to produce an approximately flat frequency response) was investigated. Localization was examined for 24 locations distributed on a sphere surrounding the listener. A single subject participated in the study using a single chosen non-individual HRTF set. Each location was repeated 6 times, resulting in a total of 144 localization reports. Overall, results were relatively consistent for 3 out of the 8 headphones tested. For these headphones, there was no significant difference in lateral angle error, associated with ITD and ILD cues. Polar angle errors, associated with the cone of confusion, however did vary significantly for these headphones. The headphone equalization had varying effects on localization accuracy depending on the headphone. Globally, headphone equalization showed no significant effect on localization accuracy. The results serve as a preliminary investigation, highlighting consistent results for only a select group of headphones tested for effective sound rendering in virtual auditory space. In addition, the results suggest that headphone equalization has a minimal influence on localization accuracy under these conditions.},

Unlike other tools, neuroprosthetics create a shared space that seamlessly spans the user's internal goal representation of the world and the external physical environment enabling a much deeper human-tool symbiosis. A key factor in the transformation of 'simple tools' into 'intelligent tools' is the concept of co-adaptation where the tool becomes functionally involved in the extraction and definition of the user's goals. Recent advancements in the neuroscience and engineering of neuroprosthetics are providing a blueprint for how new co-adaptive designs based on reinforcement learning change the nature of a user's ability to accomplish tasks that were not possible using conventional methodologies. By designing adaptive controls and artificial intelligence into the neural interface, tools can become active assistants in goal-directed behavior and further enhance human performance in particular for the disabled population.

This study develops a novel wayfinding system for smartphones that can automatically recognize the situation and scene objects in real time. Through analyzing streaming images, the proposed system first classifies the current situation of a user in terms of their location. Next, based on the current situation, only the necessary context objects are found and interpreted using computer vision techniques. It estimates the motions of the user with two inertial sensors and records the trajectories of the user toward the destination, which are also used as a guide for the return route after reaching the destination. To efficiently convey the recognized results using an auditory interface, activity-based instructions are generated that guide the user in a series of movements along a route. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed system, experiments were conducted in several indoor environments: the sit in which the situation awareness accuracy was 90{\%} and the object detection false alarm rate was 0.016. In addition, our field test results demonstrate that users can locate their paths with an accuracy of 97{\%}.},

The experiment was carried out with 30 participants, 10 were guided towards the leftmost part of the environment, 10 to the rightmost area, and 10 were used as control group where the projectiles were shot randomly throughout the game.

  abstract = {Navigating complex routes and finding objects of interest are challenging tasks for the visually impaired. The project NAVIG (Navigation Assisted by artificial VIsion and GNSS) is directed toward increasing personal autonomy via a virtual augmented reality system. The system integrates an adapted geographic information system with different classes of objects useful for improving route selection and guidance. The database also includes models of important geolocated objects that may be detected by real-time embedded vision algorithms. Object localization (relative to the user) may serve both global positioning and sensorimotor actions such as heading, grasping, or piloting. The user is guided to his desired destination through spatialized semantic audio rendering, always maintained in the head-centered reference frame. This paper presents the overall project design and architecture of the NAVIG system. In addition, details of a new type of detection and localization device are presented. This approach combines a bio-inspired vision system that can recognize and locate objects very quickly and a 3D sound rendering system that is able to perceptually position a sound at the location of the recognized object. This system was developed in relation to guidance directives developed through participative design with potential users and educators for the visually impaired. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

  abstract = {An important issue in neuroscience is the effect of visual loss on the remaining senses. Two opposing views have been advanced. On the one hand, visual loss may lead to compensatory plasticity and sharpening of the remaining senses. On the other hand, early blindness may also prevent remaining sensory modalities from a full development. In the case of sound localization, it has been reported recently that, under certain conditions, early-blind humans can localize sounds better than sighted controls. However, these studies were confined to a single sound source in the horizontal plane. This study compares sound localization of early-blind and sighted subjects in both the horizontal and vertical domain, whereas background noise was added to test more complex hearing conditions. The data show that for high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, localization by blind and sighted subjects is similar for both azimuth and elevation. At decreasing S/N ratios, the accuracy of the elevation response components deteriorated earlier than the accuracy of the azimuth component in both subject groups. However, although azimuth performance was identical for the two groups, elevation accuracy deteriorated much earlier in the blind subject group. These results indicate that auditory hypercompensation in early-blind humans does not extend to the frontal target domain, where the potential benefit of vision is maximal. Moreover, the results demonstrate for the first time that in this domain the human auditory system may require vision to optimally calibrate the elevation-related spectral pinna cues. Sensitivity to azimuth-encoding binaural difference cues, however, may be adequately calibrated in the absence of vision},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined whether spatialized nonspeech beacons could guide navigation and how sound timbre, waypoint capture radius, and practice affect performance. BACKGROUND: Auditory displays may assist mobility and wayfinding for those with temporary or permanent visual impairment, but they remain understudied. Previous systems have used speech-based interfaces. METHOD: Participants (108 undergraduates) navigated three maps, guided by one of three beacons (pink noise, sonar ping, or 1000-Hz pure tone) spatialized by a virtual reality engine. Dependent measures were efficiency of time and path length. RESULTS: Overall navigation was very successful, with significant effects of practice and capture radius, and interactions with beacon sound. Overshooting and subsequent hunting for waypoints was exacerbated for small radius conditions. A human-scale capture radius (1.5 m) and sonar-like beacon yielded the optimal combination for safety and efficiency. CONCLUSION: The selection of beacon sound and capture radius depend on the specific application, including whether speed of travel or adherence to path are of primary concern. Extended use affects sound preferences and quickly leads to improvements in both speed and accuracy. APPLICATION: These findings should lead to improved wayfinding systems for the visually impaired as well as for first responders (e.g., firefighters) and soldiers.},

Attaining this goal, TANIA uses vertical acceleration signal extrema to assess its user's walking distance. This study investigated first the sit-to-stand movement, stumbling and walking up- and down stairs of 25 subjects with visual impairments using TANIA sensor system. The objective was to improve the user's movement detection using sensors to get valid and reliable data. In a second step of the study it was investigated if there is a difference between the above-mentioned movements in people with or without visual impairments (n= 10). The acceleration signals of the subjects were compared.Three simple algorithms were found, which are able to separate the movement signals based on accelerometers of the respective daily movements. The second step analysis revealed a detectable difference in the second phase of stumbling (p= .034), where the subjects had to get back into walking forward. No differences in the other acceleration signals were found. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies a new sensorial approach to improving communication between partners during collaborative tasks taking place in abstract and non-visual virtual reality environments. The sensorial approach was investigated in the context of the search and identification of targets in a simplified 2D environment. It consists in finding a spatial configuration corresponding to a defined criterion such as a maximum, minimum, or defined score. During the collaborative search, users need to be aware of their results and also the results of their partners. In addition, they need to compare examined scores (e.g., docking score or physical value) with other results to make decisions. To support these features, an audio–haptic display was developed employing binaural audio with an intermodal stimuli synthesis design to improve the collaborative search. This rendering tool allows for simultaneous use of the audio and haptic channels which enables an efficient individual search and comparison of results. In addition, it improves the communication and activity coordination between the partners. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the contribution of the tool to improve the collaborative search of targets in a 2D non-visual environment. The results clearly show a significant improvement in performance and working efficiency with the audio–haptic display as compared to a traditional haptic-only condition. Moreover, we observed a reduction in the need for verbal communication during some steps of the search process. However, this approach introduces some communication conflicts during the steps presenting high-level interactions between partners which reduce the working efficiency of some groups. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag London.},

RL allows the BMI control algorithm to learn to complete tasks from interactions with the environment, rather than an explicit training signal. Coadaption enables continuous, synergistic adaptation between the BMI control algorithm and BMI user working in changing environments. Shaping is designed to reduce the learning curve for BMI users attempting to control a prosthetic. Here, we present the theory and in vivo experimental paradigm to illustrate how this BMI learns to complete a reaching task using a prosthetic arm in a 3-D workspace based on the user's neuronal activity. This semisupervised learning framework does not require user movements. We quantify BMI performance in closed-loop brain control over six to ten days for three rats as a function of increasing task difficulty. All three subjects coadapted with their BMI control algorithms to control the prosthetic significantly above chance at each level of difficulty.},

Our intelligent system is a human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system that interprets ubiquitous semantic entities by interacting with the physical world and the cyber domain, viz., 1) visual cues and distance sensing of material objects as line-of-sight interaction to interpret location-context information, and 2) data (tweets) from social media as event-based interaction to interpret situational vibes.

To resolve this problem a search method, namely a lost target search (LTS) which will generate efficient actions to bring the target back into the camera field of view (FoV) as soon as possible, is required. For high dimensional platforms, like a camera-mounted manipulator or an eye-in-hand system, such a search must address the difficult challenge of generating efficient actions in an online manner while avoiding kinematic constraints. In this work, we utilize the latest available information from the target just prior to leaving the FoV to initiate an optimal online search. We explain various features of our overall LTS algorithm and provide simulation comparisons with common methods existing in the literature. Finally, we implement and demonstrate the capabilities of our general algorithm on a laboratory scale 7 degree of freedom (DoF) eye-in-hand system tracking a fast moving target.},

It is clear that all possible views and images cannot be examined in a practical system. Visual attention is a complex phenomenon; we view it as a mechanism that optimizes the search processes inherent in vision (Tsotsos, 2001; Tsotsos et al., 2008) [1,2]. Here, we describe a particular example of a practical robotic vision system that employs some of these attentive processes. We cast this as an optimization problem, i.e., optimizing the probability of finding the target given a fixed cost limit in terms of total number of robotic actions required to find the visual target. Due to the inherent intractability of this problem, we present an approximate solution and investigate its performance and properties. We conclude that our approach is sufficient to solve this problem and has additional desirable empirical characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The long cane is the primary mobility tool used by people who are blind and visually impaired for independent and safe mobility and AMDs are adaptive devices that are often lightweight frames approximately body width in lateral dimension that are simply pushed forward to clear the space in front of a person. The prototype cane built for this study had a wing apparatus that could be folded around the shaft of a cane but when unfolded, deployed two wheeled wings 25 cm (9.8 in) to each side of the canetip. This project explored drop-off and obstacle detection for 6 adults with visual impairment using the deployed AMD-H and a standard long cane. The AMD-H improved obstacle detection overall, and was most effective for the smallest obstacles (2 and 6 inch diameter). The AMD-H cut the average drop off threshold from 1.79 inches (4.55 cm) to .96 inches (2.44 cm). All participants showed a decrease in drop off detection threshold and an increase in detection rate (13.9{\%} overall). For drop offs of 1 in (2.54 cm) and 3 in (7.62 cm), all participants showed large improvements with the AMD-H, ranging from 8.4 to 50{\%}. The larger drop offs of 5 in (12.7 cm) and 7 in (17.8 cm) were well detected by both types of canes.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Spatial navigation in the absence of vision has been investigated from a variety of perspectives and disciplines. These different approaches have progressed our understanding of spatial knowledge acquisition by blind individuals, including their abilities, strategies, and corresponding mental representations. In this review, we propose a framework for investigating differences in spatial knowledge acquisition by blind and sighted people consisting of three longitudinal models (i.e., convergent, cumulative, and persistent). Recent advances in neuroscience and technological devices have provided novel insights into the different neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation by blind and sighted people and the potential for functional reorganization. Despite these advances, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the extent to which locomotion and wayfinding depend on amodal spatial representations. This challenge largely stems from methodological limitations such as heterogeneity in the blind population and terminological ambiguity related to the concept of cognitive maps. Coupled with an over-reliance on potential technological solutions, the field has diffused into theoretical and applied branches that do not always communicate. Here, we review research on navigation by congenitally blind individuals with an emphasis on behavioral and neuroscientific evidence, as well as the potential of technological assistance. Throughout the article, we emphasize the need to disentangle strategy choice and performance when discussing the navigation abilities of the blind population.

Our long-term goal is to create a portable, self-contained system that will allow visually impaired individuals to travel through familiar and unfamiliar environments without the assistance of guides. The system, as it exists now, consists of the following functional components: (1) a module for determining the traveler's posi- tion and orientation in space, (2) a Geographic Information System comprising a de- tailed database of our test site and software for route planning and for obtaining infor- mation from the database, and (3) the user interface. The experiment reported here is concerned with one function of the navigation system: guiding the traveler along a predefined route. We evaluate guidance performance as a function of four different display modes: one involving spatialized sound from a virtual acoustic display, and three involving verbal commands issued by a synthetic speech display. The virtual dis- play mode fared best in terms of both guidance performance and user preferences.},

Virtual Machine (VM) allocation is one of the challenging tasks in the data center management since user requirements, typically expressed as SLAs, have to be met with the minimum operational expenditure. Despite their huge processing and storage facilities, data centers are among the major contributors of the GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions of the IT services. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach for a large-scale Cloud system where the Cloud services are provisioned by several data centers interconnected over the backbone network. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that aims at virtualizing the backbone topology and placing the VMs in data centers with the objective of minimum power consumption. We compare our proposed solution with a benchmark MILP model which selects the closest data centers that can accommodate the user requests taking into account the CPU, memory, and bandwidth capacities of the residing physical hosts. Collected experimental results show the benefit of the proposed management scheme in terms of power consumption, resource utilization, and fairness for medium size data centers. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach   - Six persons with a VI who were white cane users were tasked with traversing a predetermined route in a corridor environment using the haptic navigation system. To see whether white cane experience translated to using the system, the participants received no prior training. The procedures were video-recorded, and the participants were interviewed about their conceptions of using the system. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis, where inductively generated codes that emerged from the data were clustered together and formulated into categories.   Findings   - The participants quickly figured out how to use the system, and soon adopted their own usage technique. Despite this, locating objects was difficult. The interviews highlighted the desire to be able to feel at a distance, with several scenarios presented to illustrate current problems. The participants noted that their previous white cane experience helped, but that it nevertheless would take a lot of practice to master using this system. The potential for the device to increase security in unfamiliar environments was mentioned. Practical problems with the prototype were also discussed, notably the lack of auditory feedback.   Originality/value   - One novel aspect of this field trial is the way it was carried out. Prior training was intentionally not provided, which means that the findings reflect immediate user experiences. The findings confirm the value of being able to perceive things beyond the range of the white cane; at the same time, the participants expressed concerns about that ability. Another key feature is that the prototype should be seen as a navigation aid rather than an obstacle avoidance device, despite the interaction similarities with the white cane. As such, the intent is not to replace the white cane as a primary means of detecting obstacles.},

Recently, wearable cameras have begun to be exploited. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of egocentric vision systems for the recognition of ADLs following a hierarchical structure: motion, action and activity levels, where each level provides higher semantic information and involves a longer time frame. The current egocentric vision literature suggests that ADLs recognition is mainly driven by the objects present in the scene, especially those associated with specific tasks. However, although object-based approaches have proven popular, object recognition remains a challenge due to the intra-class variations found in unconstrained scenarios. As a consequence, the performance of current systems is far from satisfactory.},

We specifically investigated how blind people use their senses to compensate for the lack of visual information and how the priority of senses changes according to the urban context. The participants of the study consisted of nine congenitally blind individuals and the study took place in two urban settings: a dense urban district, Kemeralti district in İzmir; and an urban park, the İzmir Fair Park. During the learning phase, a first trial along the selected routes was conducted for each participant individually along with one of the researchers. In the test phase, the participants were requested to re-walk the route and verbally report the environmental cues they attended to. The participants' verbal reports were recorded and transcripts of the recordings were coded according to the environmental sensory inputs. In addition, the short-term memory of each participant was also evaluated. The results show that the characteristics of the urban environment seem to have an impact on way-finding strategies of blind individuals. It was found that the sound of the city and the echo from the environment are the most important factors for blind participants in the dense urban environment. Environmental boundaries provided echoes and gave a sense of enclosure that helped them orient themselves, whereas, in the park environment, the sense of enclosure was not enhanced due to a lack of boundaries in the environment.},

To this end, we have developed a method to model such actions using a hidden Markov model (HMM) representation.

These results suggest that visual experience may be used to accurately calibrate the relation between the vertical coordinates of auditory space and body, but is not needed to develop sufficiently high resolution of spatial hearing. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this work, we consider an essential problem in NRS, namely how to perform task planning given the limitations both in on-board sensing as well as in the environment's sensors. Partially observable Markov decisions processes (POMDPs) form an attractive framework to address planning in the uncertain environments that typify NRS. We show how to model a typical cooperative perception task in a NRS, namely tracking and classifying people, and we present experiments that show how the proposed approach results in an effective interplay between robot and environment sensors.},

  abstract = {Pioneer experiments on saccadic suppression have shown that this effect is not followed by motor disorientation: Conscious perception of a target displacement can be dissociated from correct manual target reaching. It has subsequently been demonstrated that movement corrections with the same latency and spatial characteristics can be produced in conditions allowing perceptual awareness of perturbation of a target as in condition inducing saccadic suppression. In addition to the qualitative dissociation between motor performance and conscious awareness, quantitative temporal dissociations in action can be observed by manipulating different features of the visual target. When the target of an ongoing simple action is perturbed, a temporal advantage is found for responses to perturbations of location relative to colour and shape. Furthermore, there seems to be a temporal advantage for automatic motor corrections made in response to a target displacement as compared to other responses (other ongoing movement adjustments, movement interruption, conditional motor response such as pressing a key, verbal response, delayed matching-to-sample tasks). Thus, this paper reviews evidence for the fact that the temporal characteristics of any given response to a stimulus are dependent both on the sensory processes and on the type of response generated. Accordingly, identification responses (such as verbal report) to a visual stimulus are much slower than motor corrections of an ongoing movement in response to a target location change because of different processing times of the stimulus features ('What' compared to 'Where') and of the response itself ('What' compared to 'How'). The existence of two continua (What/Where and What/How) is proposed between these two extreme stimulus response combinations. This model may be a useful framework to better understand visuo-motor transformations and the network of connections between visual and motor areas.},

  abstract = {Do blind persons develop capacities of their remaining senses that exceed those of sighted individuals? Besides anecdotal suggestions, two views based on experimental studies have been advanced. The first proposes that blind individuals should be severely impaired, given that vision is essential to develop spatial concepts. The second suggests that compensation occurs through the remaining senses, allowing them to develop an accurate concept of space. Here we investigate how an ecologically critical function, namely three-dimensional spatial mapping, is carried out by early-blind individuals with or without residual vision. Subjects were tested under monaural and binaural listening conditions. We find that early-blind subjects can map the auditory environment with equal or better accuracy than sighted subjects. Furthermore, unlike sighted subjects, they can correctly localize sounds monaurally. Surprisingly, blind individuals with residual peripheral vision localized sounds less precisely than sighted or totally blind subjects, confirming that compensation varies according to the aetiology and extent of blindness. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy in that they provide behavioural evidence that totally blind individuals have better auditory ability than sighted subjects, enabling them to compensate for their loss of vision.},

The proposed framework is able to model and estimate even complex user intents, i.e. wheelchair maneuvers that the driver has in mind. Furthermore, it explicitly takes the uncertainty on the user's intent into account. Besides during intent estimation, user-specific properties and uncertainty on the user's intent are incorporated when taking assistive actions, such that assistance is tailored to the user's driving skills. This decision making is modeled as a greedy Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Benefits of this approach are shown using experimental results in simulation and on our wheelchair platform Sharioto.},

Many assistive technology devices use ultrasonic pulse-echo techniques to gauge subject to object distance. Some use infrared light transceivers or laser technology to locate and warn of obstacles. These devices exhibit a number of problems, the most significant of which are related to the interface display that conveys navigation/obstacle warning information to the user. Other sensory channels should not be compromised by the device. This is exactly what can happen when, for example, audio signals are used in obstacle warning on/off displays or more significantly in orientation solutions, where continuous streams of synthetically generated stereo sound mask the natural ambient sound cues used by the blind. Despite the challenges, the commendable feature all these assistive device developers have in common is; they are striving to help a section of the population with a severe disability. Even if there is only partial success in this endevour to assist the blind, the small companies that produce these devices all have the right motive. That is a big step in the right direction. The author has attempted to address some of the problems mentioned in this paper by producing a first working prototype.

We present a general framework which allows for a novel set of linear solutions to the pose estimation problem for both n points and n lines. We then analyze the sensitivity of our solutions to image noise and show that the sensitivity analysis can be used as a conservative predictor of error for our algorithms.

We propose a new wayfinding aid based on a camera cell phone, which is held by the user to find and read aloud specially designed machine-readable signs in the environment (labeling locations such as offices and restrooms). Our main technical innovation is that we have designed these machine-readable signs to be detected and located in fractions of a second on the cell phone CPU, even at a distance of several meters. A linear barcode printed on the sign is read using novel decoding algorithms that are robust to noisy images. The information read from the barcode is then read aloud using pre-recorded or synthetic speech. We have implemented a prototype system on the Nokia 7610 cell phone, and preliminary experiments with blind subjects demonstrate the feasibility of using the system as a real-time wayfinding aid. 2 1},

We produce a novel egocentric vision dataset to demonstrate how semantic labeling can be applied to this problem. We also improve the speed of semantic labeling with sparse computation of unary potentials, enabling its use in real-time wearable assistive devices. We use simulated prosthetic vision to demonstrate the results of our technique. Our approach allows a prosthetic vision system to selectively highlight specific classes of objects in the user's field of view, improving the user's situational awareness.},

The optimal evolutions of P(lambda) and lambda(t), which are approximated using B-spline functions, are found using a nonlinear optimization technique. The proposed method accounts for the most important constraints inherent to the system behavior, such as underactuation, obstacles avoidance and limits on actuator torques and speeds.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

  abstract = {The See Color interface transforms a small portion of a colored video image into sound sources represented by spatialized musical instruments. Basically, the conversion of colors into sounds is achieved by quantization of the HSL color system. Our purpose is to provide visually impaired individuals with a capability of perception of the environment in real time. In this work we present the system principles of design and several experiments that have been carried out by several blindfolded persons with See ColOr prototypes related to static pictures on a tablet and simple video images. The goal of the first experiment was to identify the colors of static pictures' main features and then to interpret the image scenes. Although learning all instrument sounds in only a training session was too difficult, participants found that colors were helpful to limit the possible image interpretations. The experiments on the analysis of static pictures suggested that the order of magnitude of the slow down factor related to the use of the auditory channel, instead of the visual channel could correspond to the order of magnitude related to the ratio of visual channel capacity to auditory channel capacity. Afterwards, two experiments based on a head mounted camera have been performed. The first experiment pertaining to object manipulation is based on the pairing of colored socks, while the second experiment is related to outdoor navigation with the goal of following a colored serpentine painted on the ground. The "socks" experiment demonstrated that blindfolded individuals were able to accurately match pairs of colored socks. The same participants with the addition of a blind individual successfully followed a red serpentine painted on the ground for more than 80 m. According to task time durations, the order of magnitude of the slow down factor related to the "socks" and "serpentine" experiments could be equal to one. From a cognitive perspective this would be consistent with the fact that these two tasks are simpler than the interpretation of image scenes. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Starting from very sparse initial scene knowledge, a map of natural point features spanning a section of a room is generated on-the-fly as the motion of the camera is simultaneously estimated in full 3D. Naturally this permits the annotation of the scene with rigidly-registered graphics, but further it permits automatic control of the robot's active camera: for instance, fixation on a particular object can be maintained during extended periods of arbitrary user motion, then shifted at will to another object which has potentially been out of the field of view. This kind of functionality is the key to the understanding or "management" of a workspace which the robot needs to have in order to assist its wearer usefully in tasks. We believe that the techniques and technology developed are of particular immediate value in scenarios of remote collaboration, where a remote expert is able to annotate, through the robot, the environment the wearer is working in.},

In contrast to tradi- tionally used assistive tools, such as screen readers and magnifiers, the new interface employs a combination of both audio and haptic features to provide spatial and navigational information to users. The haptic features are presented via a low-cost force feedback mouse allowing blind people to interact with the Web, in a similar fashion to their sighted counterparts. The audio provides navigational and textual information through the use of non-speech sounds and synthesised speech. Interacting with the multimodal interface offers a novel experience to target users, especially to those with total blindness. A series of experiments have been conducted to ascertain the usability of the interface and compare its performance to that of a traditional screen reader. Results have shown the advantages that the new multi- modal interface offers blind and visually impaired peo- ple. This includes the enhanced perception of the spatial layout of Web pages, and navigation towards elements on a page. Certain issues regarding the design of the haptic and audio features raised in the evaluation are discussed and presented in terms of recommendations for future work.},

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

formulated as that of minimizing an error metric based on collinearity
in object (as opposed to image) space. Using object space collinearity
error, we derive an iterative algorithm which directly computes
orthogonal rotation matrices and which is globally convergent.
Experimentally, we show that the method is computationally efficient,
that it is no less accurate than the best currently employed
optimization methods, and that it outperforms all tested methods in
robustness to outliers},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the concept of dense scene flow for visual SLAM applications. Traditional visual SLAM methods assume static features in the environment and that a dominant part of the scene changes only due to camera egomotion. These assumptions make traditional visual SLAM methods prone to failure in crowded real-world dynamic environments with many independently moving objects, such as the typical environments for the visually impaired. By means of a dense scene flow representation, moving objects can be detected. In this way, the visual SLAM process can be improved considerably, by not adding erroneous measurements into the estimation, yielding more consistent and improved localization and mapping results. We show large-scale visual SLAM results in challenging indoor and outdoor crowded environments with real visually impaired users. In particular, we performed experiments inside the Atocha railway station and in the city-center of Alcalá de Henares, both in Madrid, Spain. Our results show that the combination of visual SLAM and dense scene flow allows to obtain an accurate localization, improving considerably the results of traditional visual SLAM methods and GPS-based approaches.

  abstract = {Offering an alternative mode of interaction with the surrounding 3-D space to the visually impaired for collision free navigation is a goal of great significance that includes several key challenges. In this paper, we study the alternative 3-D space sensation that is interpreted by our computer vision prototype system and transferred to the user via a vibration array. There are two main tasks for conducting such a study. The first task is to detect obstacles in close proximity, and motion patterns in image sequences, both important issues for a safe navigation in a 3-D dynamic space. To achieve this task, the images from the left and right cameras are acquired to produce new stereo images, followed by video stabilization as a preprocessing stage, a nonlinear spatio-temporal diffusion and kernel based density estimation method to assess the motion activity, and finally watershed-based detection of moving regions (or obstacles) of interest. The second task is to efficiently represent the information of the captured static and dynamic visual scenes as 3-D detectable patterns of vibrations applied on the human body to create a 3-D sensation of the space during navigation. To accomplish this task, considering the current limitations imposed by the technology, we create a high-to-low (H-L) image resolution representation scheme to facilitate the mapping onto a low-resolution 2-D array of vibrators. The H-L scheme uses pyramidal modeling to obtain low-resolution images of interest-preserving motion and obstacles-that are mapped onto a vibration array. These patterns are utilized to train and test the performance of the users in free space navigation. Thus, in this paper we study the synergy of these two important schemes to offer an alternative sensation of the 3-D space to the visually impaired via an array of vibrators. Particularly, the motion component is employed as an element for the identification of visual information of interest to be retained during the H-L tran- formation. The role of the array vibrators is to create a small-scale front representation of the space via various levels of vibrations. Thus, 3-D vibrations applied on the user's body (chest, abdomen) offer a 3-D sensation of the surrounding space and the motion in it. In addition, we present experimental results that indicate the efficiency of this navigation scheme in creating low-resolution 3-D views of the free navigation space and detecting obstacles and moving areas.},

Outdoors, it uses DGPS as its location system to keep the user as close as possible to the central line of sidewalks of campus and downtown areas; it provides the user with an optimal route by means of its dynamic routing and rerouting ability. The user can switch the system from an outdoor to an indoor environment with a simple vocal command. An OEM ultrasound positioning system is used to provide precise indoor location measurements. Experiments show an in-door accuracy of 22 cm. The user can get vocal prompts to avoid possible obstacles and step-by-step walking guidance to move about in an indoor environment.

First, we conducted a gesture elicitation study in which 10 blind and 10 sighted people invented gestures to perform common computing tasks on a tablet PC. We found that blind people have different gesture preferences than sighted people, including preferences for edge-based gestures and gestures that involve tapping virtual keys on a keyboard. Second, we conducted a performance study in which the same participants performed a set of reference gestures. We found significant differences in the speed, size, and shape of gestures performed by blind people versus those performed by sighted people.

Amongst all the possible applications, AR systems can be very useful as visualization tools for structural and environmental monitoring. While the large majority of AR systems run on a laptop or on a head-mounted device, the advent of smartphones have created new opportunities. One of the most important functionality of an AR system is the ability of the device to self localize. This can be achieved through visual odometry, a very challenging task for smartphone. Indeed, on most of the available smartphone AR applications, self localization is achieved through GPS and/or inertial sensors. Hence, developing an AR system on a mobile phone also poses new challenges due to the limited amount of computational resources. In this paper we describe the development of a egomotion estimation algorithm for an Android smartphone. We also present an approach based on an Extended Kalman Filter for improving localization accuracy integrating the information from inertial sensors. The implemented solution achieves a localization accuracy comparable to the PC implementation while running on an Android device.},

This kind of obstacles are specially dangerous because they could not be detected by the walking stick. The algorithm maintains a local 3D map of the vicinity of the user, which is estimated through a 6DOF egomotion algorithm. The trajectory is used to predict the next movement of the blind and the 3D information of the local map is used to evaluate a possible aerial obstacles in the next pose. A key stabilization algorithm is introduced in order to maintain the floor of the map continuously aligned with the horizontal plane. This is a very important task, because in a wearable 3D device, the relative transformation of the camera reference system with respect to the user and the environment is continuously changed. In the experimental section, we show the results of the algorithm in several situations using real data.},

  abstract = {Visual place recognition is a challenging problem due to the vast range of ways in which the appearance of real-world places can vary. In recent years, improvements in visual sensing capabilities, an ever-increasing focus on long-term mobile robot autonomy, and the ability to draw on state-of-the-art research in other disciplines—particularly recognition in computer vision and animal navigation in neuroscience—have all contributed to significant advances in visual place recognition systems. This paper presents a survey of the visual place recognition research landscape. We start by introducing the concepts behind place recognition—the role of place recognition in the animal kingdom, how a “place” is defined in a robotics context, and the major components of a place recognition system. Long-term robot operations have revealed that changing appearance can be a significant factor in visual place recognition failure; therefore, we discuss how place recognition solutions can implicitly or explicitly account for appearance change within the environment. Finally, we close with a discussion on the future of visual place recognition, in particular with respect to the rapid advances being made in the related fields of deep learning, semantic scene understanding, and video description.},

Participating in this project implied active dialogue with the community to recognize the knowledge of each participant and achieve culturally relevant representations materialized in technological artifacts. We posit dialogue, representation and recognition as key elements for developing successful participatory design. In practice, this was achieved through an iterative, incremental and open-ended methodology, whose main feature was engagement by doing. This process of design allowed engineers to recognize the craftswomen's traditional knowledge and allowed craftswomen to be less afraid of technology. The main resultant artifact was a tangible user interface that facilitates dialogue between fashion designers and embroiderers in the process of designing new embroidery patterns. This and other artifacts that emerged from the activities and dialogues, the level of engagement of the participants, and the convergence points discovered between embroidery and technology, lead us to conclude that the process presented here can be replicated with other craft communities, to reinforce these communities and assist them in generating innovation in their processes and products.},

  abstract      = {Indoor localization and navigation systems for individuals with visual impairments (VI) typically rely upon extensive augmentation of the physical space or heavy, expensive sensors; thus, few systems have been adopted. This work describes a system able to guide people with VI through buildings using inexpensive sensors, such as accelerometers, which are available in portable devices like smart phones. The method takes advantage of feedback from the human user, who confirms the presence of landmarks. The system calculates the user's location in real time and uses it to provide audio instructions on how to reach the desired destination. Previous work suggested that the accuracy of the approach depended on the type of directions and the availability of an appropriate transition model for the user. A critical parameter for the transition model is the user's step length. The current work investigates different schemes for automatically computing the user's step length and reducing the dependency of the approach to the definition of an accurate transition model. Furthermore, the direction provision method is able to use the localization estimate and adapt to failed executions of paths by the users. Experiments are presented that evaluate the accuracy of the overall integrated system, which is executed online on a smart phone. Both people with visual impairments, as well as blindfolded sighted people, participated in the experiments. The experiments included paths along multiple floors, that required the use of stairs and elevators. $\backslash${\&}copy; 2012 IEEE.},

The analysis of the literature reveals that only in a few cases the possibility of a temporal evolution of the co-adaptation parameters has been considered. In particular, it has been overlooked the role of time-related indexes that capture changes in motor and cognitive abilities of the human operator. We argue that for a more effective long-term co-adaptation process, the interface should be able to predict and adjust its parameters according to the evolution of human skills and performance. We thus propose a novel approach termed progressive co-adaptation, whereby human performance is continuously monitored and the system makes inferences about changes in the users' cognitive and motor skills. We illustrate the features of progressive co-adaptation in two possible applications, robotic telemanipulation and active vision for the visually impaired.},

Using camera pose estimates with dense 3D data obtained from stereo triangulation, we build a vicinity map of the user's environment. On this map, we perform 3D traversability analysis to steer subjects away from obstacles in the path. A tactile interface consisting of microvibration motors provides cues for taking evasive action, as determined by our vision processing algorithms. We report experimental results of our system (running at 10 Hz) and conduct mobility tests with blindfolded subjects to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach over conventional navigational aids like the white cane.},

Specif-ically, we focus on the problem of visual-inertial odometry (VIO), in which the objective is to track the motion of a mobile platform in an unknown environment. Our primary interest is navigation using miniature devices with limited computational resources, similar for example to a mobile phone. Our proposed estimation framework consists of two main components: (i) a hybrid EKF estimator that integrates two algorithms with complementary computational characteristics, namely a sliding-window EKF and EKF-based SLAM, and (ii) an adaptive image-processing module that adjusts the number of detected image features based on the availability of resources. By combining the hybrid EKF estimator, which optimally utilizes the feature measurements, with the adaptive image-processing algorithm, the proposed estimation architecture fully utilizes the system's computational resources. We present experimental results showing that the proposed estimation framework is capable of real-time processing of image and inertial data on the processor of a mobile phone.},

Information was provided en route about the direction of the next turning point, by spatial language ("left," "right," or "straight") or virtual sound (i.e., the perceived azimuth of the sound indicated the target direction). The authors hypothesized that virtual sound, being processed at direct perceptual levels, would have lower load than even simple language commands, which require cognitive mediation. As predicted, whereas the guidance modes did not differ significantly in the no-load condition, participants showed shorter distance traveled and less time to complete a path when performing the N-back task while navigating with virtual sound as guidance. Virtual sound also produced better N-back performance than spatial language. By indicating the superiority of virtual sound for guidance when cognitive load is present, as is characteristic of everyday navigation, these results have implications for guidance systems for the visually impaired and others.},

  abstract  = {Background Global and regional prevalence estimates for blindness and vision impairment are important for the development of public health policies. We aimed to provide global estimates, trends, and projections of global blindness and vision impairment. Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based datasets relevant to global vision impairment and blindness that were published between 1980 and 2015. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate the prevalence (by age, country, and sex), in 2015, of mild visual impairment (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/12 to 6/18 inclusive), moderate to severe visual impairment (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/18 to 3/60 inclusive), blindness (presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60), and functional presbyopia (defined as presenting near vision worse than N6 or N8 at 40 cm when best-corrected distance visual acuity was better than 6/12). Findings Globally, of the 7{\textperiodcentered}33 billion people alive in 2015, an estimated 36{\textperiodcentered}0 million (80{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 12{\textperiodcentered}9–65{\textperiodcentered}4) were blind (crude prevalence 0{\textperiodcentered}48{\%}; 80{\%} UI 0{\textperiodcentered}17–0{\textperiodcentered}87; 56{\%} female), 216{\textperiodcentered}6 million (80{\%} UI 98{\textperiodcentered}5–359{\textperiodcentered}1) people had moderate to severe visual impairment (2{\textperiodcentered}95{\%}, 80{\%} UI 1{\textperiodcentered}34–4{\textperiodcentered}89; 55{\%} female), and 188{\textperiodcentered}5 million (80{\%} UI 64{\textperiodcentered}5–350{\textperiodcentered}2) had mild visual impairment (2{\textperiodcentered}57{\%}, 80{\%} UI 0{\textperiodcentered}88–4{\textperiodcentered}77; 54{\%} female). Functional presbyopia affected an estimated 1094{\textperiodcentered}7 million (80{\%} UI 581{\textperiodcentered}1–1686{\textperiodcentered}5) people aged 35 years and older, with 666{\textperiodcentered}7 million (80{\%} UI 364{\textperiodcentered}9–997{\textperiodcentered}6) being aged 50 years or older. The estimated number of blind people increased by 17{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}, from 30{\textperiodcentered}6 million (80{\%} UI 9{\textperiodcentered}9–57{\textperiodcentered}3) in 1990 to 36{\textperiodcentered}0 million (80{\%} UI 12{\textperiodcentered}9–65{\textperiodcentered}4) in 2015. This change was attributable to three factors, namely an increase because of population growth (38{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}), population ageing after accounting for population growth (34{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}), and reduction in age-specific prevalence (−36{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}). The number of people with moderate and severe visual impairment also increased, from 159{\textperiodcentered}9 million (80{\%} UI 68{\textperiodcentered}3–270{\textperiodcentered}0) in 1990 to 216{\textperiodcentered}6 million (80{\%} UI 98{\textperiodcentered}5–359{\textperiodcentered}1) in 2015. Interpretation There is an ongoing reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and visual impairment, yet the growth and ageing of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in number of people affected. These observations, plus a very large contribution from uncorrected presbyopia, highlight the need to scale up vision impairment alleviation efforts at all levels.

However, it is unclear whether Fitts' law holds for visually guided actions under visually restricted conditions. We tested whether Fitts' law applies under various conditions of visual restriction and compared pointing movements in each condition. Ten healthy participants performed four pointing movement tasks under different visual feedback conditions, including full-vision (FV), no-hand-movement (NM), no-target-location (NT), and no-vision (NV) feedback conditions. The movement times (MTs) for each task exhibited highly linear relationships with the index of difficulty (r2{\textgreater} 96). These findings suggest that pointing movements follow Fitts' law even when visual feedback is restricted or absent. However, the MTs and accuracy of pointing movements decreased for difficult tasks involving visual restriction. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Experiment I consisted in collecting subjects' perceptions in a free-response format to identify relevant criteria for multi-dimensional spatial sound reproduction of complex auditory scenes by means of linguistic analysis. Experiment II utilized both free response and scale judgments for seven parameters derived form Experiment I. Results indicated a strong correlation between the source material (sound scene) and the subjective evaluation of the parameters, making the notion of an "optimal" reproduction method difficult for arbitrary source material.},

  abstract  = {Navigation, especially in unknown areas, remains a major problem for the visually impaired (VI). Over the past 50 years, a number of electronic travel aids (ETAs) have been developed with the aim of improving the mobility of the VI. Despite the efforts, these systems are rarely used. Although the explanation is likely to be incomplete, it is possible to identify three important factors: (1) positioning accuracy provided by these devices is not sufficient to guide a VI pedestrian, (2) these systems are based on Geographical Information Systems not adapted to pedestrian mobility, and (3) the guidance methods should be adapted to the task of pedestrian navigation. The NAVIG project aims to answer all these limitations through a participatory design framework with the VI and orientation and mobility instructors. The NAVIG device aims to complement conventional mobility aids (i.e. white cane and guide dog), while also adding unique features to localize specific objects in the environment, restore some visuomotor abilities, and assist navigation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

  abstract  = {We describe some of the results of our program of basic and applied research on navigating without vision. One basic research topic that we have studied extensively is path integration, a form of navigation in which perceived self-motion is integrated over time to obtain an estimate of current position and orientation. In experiments on pathway completion, one test of path integration ability, we have found that subjects who are passively guided over the outbound path without vision exhibit significant errors when attempting to return to the origin but are nevertheless sensitive to turns and segment lengths in the stimulus path. We have also found no major differences in path integration ability among blind and sighted populations. A model we have developed that attributes errors in path integration to errors in encoding the stimulus path is a good beginning toward understanding path integration performance. In other research on path integration, in which optic flow information was manipulated in addition to the proprioceptive and vestibular information of nonvisual locomotion, we have found that optic flow is a weak input to the path integration process. In other basic research, our studies of auditory distance perception in outdoor environments show systematic underestimation of sound source distance. Our applied research has been concerned with developing and evaluating a navigation system for the visually impaired that uses three recent technologies: the Global Positioning System, Geographic Information Systems, and virtual acoustics. Our work shows that there is considerable promise of these three technologies in allowing visually impaired individuals to navigate and learn about unfamiliar environments without the assistance of human guides.},

  abstract  = {Blind people may compensate for their visual loss by the increased use of auditory spatial information, thus showing normal or even supra-normal ability to localize sources of sound. However, the problem of how blind persons develop and maintain an internal concept of the topography of the auditory space in the absence of calibration by visual information is still unsolved. The present study demonstrated a substantial superiority of blind subjects in perception of auditory motion: The minimum audible movement angle of blind subjects (mean 3°) was about half the value found in matched sighted controls, whereas no such advantage was demonstrable for localization of stationary sound. There were no significant differences between early or congenitally blind subjects and late blind subjects, suggesting that long-term visual deprivation per se, independently of the point in time of its onset, was relevant for the superiority in auditory motion perception. The results were compatible with the hypothesis that in the absence of visual input the calibration of the auditory space is performed by audiomotor feedback, that is, by the evaluation of systematic changes of auditory spatial cues resulting from head and body movements. It is reasonable to assume that with blindness the neuronal circuits specifically concerned with the analysis of auditory motion are more intensely trained than in sighted people. It seems possible that the higher demand of motion analysis associated with blindness is related to processes of reorganization in the brain, as have been previously reported to occur also in areas known to be involved in auditory and/or visual motion analysis in sighted persons. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the study presented here, we enlist the advice and ideas of individuals who are blind with respect to this challenge, for an envisioned camera-based aid to navigation and wayfinding. Methods: We administered a short questionnaire about user preferences and needs for such a device to a sample of 10 well-educated, employed (or retired) visually impaired participants with light perception or less, who were familiar and comfortable with assistive technology. Generally, the items were rankings of relative priority. Results: Participants preferred speech as a communications medium for navigating the environment; preferred controlling the auditory display by querying the system rather than interacting via a menu or receiving a stream of continuous speech; and preferred providing input to the system through a keypad rather than through a voice recognition system. Architectural features such as doors and stairs were ranked the most important environmental objects to be located with such a device (over furniture, persons, personal items, and even text signs). Discussion: Our sample reported a desire for devices that can guide them to architectural features of their environment. They appear to prefer device interfaces that give them control, and would rather query a system than interact with a menu. They prefer unobtrusive input on a device via keypad rather than through voice recognition. Implications for practitioners: Designers of camera-based navigation devices may wish to consider the preferences of our sample by incorporating a query-based interface with simple keypad input and speech output, and to include in their object recognition efforts the goal of identifying architectural features that are significant to users who are blind in navigation.},

  abstract = {Independent travel is a well known challenge for blind and visually impaired persons. In this paper, we propose a proof-of-concept computer vision-based wayfinding aid for blind people to independently access unfamiliar indoor environments. In order to find different rooms (e.g. an office, a lab, or a bathroom) and other building amenities (e.g. an exit or an elevator), we incorporate object detection with text recognition. First we develop a robust and efficient algorithm to detect doors, elevators, and cabinets based on their general geometric shape, by combining edges and corners. The algorithm is general enough to handle large intra-class variations of objects with different appearances among different indoor environments, as well as small inter-class differences between different objects such as doors and door-like cabinets. Next, in order to distinguish intra-class objects (e.g. an office door from a bathroom door), we extract and recognize text information associated with the detected objects. For text recognition, we first extract text regions from signs with multiple colors and possibly complex backgrounds, and then apply character localization and topological analysis to filter out background interference. The extracted text is recognized using off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) software products. The object type, orientation, location, and text information are presented to the blind traveler as speech.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a novel wearable RGB-D camera based indoor navigation system for the visually impaired is presented. The system guides the visually impaired user from one location to another location without a prior map or GPS information. Accurate real-time egomotion estimation, mapping, and path planning in the presence of obstacles are essential for such a system. We perform real-time 6-DOF egomotion estimation using sparse visual features, dense point clouds, and the ground plane to reduce drift from a head-mounted RGB-D camera. The system also builds 2D probabilistic occupancy grid map for efficient traversability analysis which is a basis for dynamic path planning and obstacle avoidance. The system can store and reload maps generated by the system while traveling and continually expand the coverage area of navigation. Next, the shortest path between the start location to destination is generated. The system generates a safe and efficient way point based on the traversability analysis result and the shortest path and updates the way point while a user is constantly moving. Appropriate cues are generated and delivered to a tactile feedback system to guide the visually impaired user to the way point. The proposed wearable system prototype is composed of multiple modules including a head-mounted RGB-D camera, standard laptop that runs a navigation software, smart phone user interface, and haptic feedback vest. The proposed system achieves real-time navigation performance at 28.6Hz in average on a laptop, and helps the visually impaired extends the range of their activities and improve the orientation and mobility performance in a cluttered environment. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed system in mapping and localization with blind-folded and the visually impaired subjects. The mobility experiment results show that navigation in indoor environments with the proposed system avoids collisions successfully and improves mobility performance of the user compared to conventional and state-of-the-art mobility aid devices.},

  abstract  = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Audio user interfaces for GPS have typically been designed to meet the needs of visually impaired users, and generally (though not exclusively) employ speech-audio. In contrast, our prototype system uses a simple form of non-speech, spatial audio. This paper analyses various candidate audio mappings of location and distance information. A variety of tasks, design considerations, technological opportunities and design trade-offs are considered. The findings from pilot evaluation experiments are reported. Finally, opportunities for improvements to the system and for future empirical testing are explored.},

The spatial hearing of thirty-five children with visual disabilities (twenty-two with congenital total blindness) was compared with that of eighteen sighted children and seventeen sighted adults. The tests provided a comprehensive assessment of spatial-hearing ability, including psychophysical estimates of spatial resolution in the horizontal, vertical, and distance dimensions, as well as measures of reaching and walking to the locations of sound sources. The spatial hearing of the children with visual disabilities was comparable to or somewhat better than that of the sighted children and adults. This pattern held even when the group with visual disabilities was restricted to those children with congenital total blindness; in fact, some of those children had exceptionally good spatial hearing. These findings imply that the developmental calibration of human spatial hearing is not dependent on a history of visual experience. It seems likely that this calibration arises from the experience of changes in sound-localization cues arising from self-motion, such as turning the head or walking. As a practical matter, orientation and mobility instructors may reasonably assume that individuals with visual disabilities can use their hearing effectively in day-to-day travel situations.},

  abstract  = {Monaural spectral features due to pinna diffraction are the primary cues for elevation. Because these features appear above 3 kHz where the wavelength becomes comparable to pinna size, it is generally believed that accurate elevation estimation requires wideband sources. However, psychoacoustic tests show that subjects can estimate elevation for low-frequency sources. In the experiments reported, random noise bursts low-pass filtered to 3 kHz were processed with individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), and six subjects were asked to report the elevation angle around four cones of confusion. The accuracy in estimating elevation was degraded when compared to a baseline test with wideband stimuli. The reduction in performance was a function of azimuth and was highest in the median plane. However, when the source was located away from the median plane, subjects were able to estimate elevation, often with surprisingly good accuracy. Analysis of the HRTFs reveals the existence of elevation-dependent features at low frequencies. The physical origin of the low-frequency features is attributed primarily to head diffraction and torso reflections. It is shown that simple geometrical approximations and models of the head and torso explain these low-frequency features and the corresponding elevations cues.},

The second experiment investigates the potential of the system in providing subjects with spatial knowledge: specifically in helping with the construction of a cognitive map depicting simple geometrical objects. Results from both experiments show that the proposed concept, design, and implementation allow to effectively exploit the complementary natures of the "proximal" haptic modality and the "distal" auditory modality.

  abstract  = {In the last decades there has been a tremendous increase in demand for Assistive Technologies (AT) useful to overcome functional limitations of individuals and to improve their quality of life. As a consequence, different research papers addressing the development of assistive technologies have appeared into the literature pushing the need to organize and categorize them taking into account the application assistive aims. Several surveys address the categorization problem for works concerning a specific need, hence giving the overview on the state of the art technologies supporting the related function for the individual. Unfortunately, this “user-need oriented” way of categorization considers each technology as a whole and then a deep and critical explanation of the technical knowledge used to build the operative tasks as well as a discussion on their cross-contextual applicability is completely missing making thus existing surveys unlikely to be technically inspiring for functional improvements and to explore new technological frontiers. To overcome this critical drawback, in this paper an original “task oriented” way to categorize the state of the art of the AT works has been introduced: it relies on the split of the final assistive goals into tasks that are then used as pointers to the works in literature in which each of them has been used as a component. In particular this paper concentrates on a set of cross-application Computer Vision tasks that are set as the pivots to establish a categorization of the AT already used to assist some of the user's needs. For each task the paper analyzes the Computer Vision algorithms recently involved in the development of AT and, finally, it tries to catch a glimpse of the possible paths in the short and medium term that could allow a real improvement of the assistive outcomes. The potential impact on the assessment of AT considering users, medical, economical and social perspective is also addressed.},

  abstract      = {Natural and intuitive human interaction with robotic systems is a key point to develop robots assisting people in an easy and effective way. In this paper, a Human Robot Interaction (HRI) system able to recognize gestures usually employed in human non-verbal communication is introduced, and an in-depth study of its usability is performed. The system deals with dynamic gestures such as waving or nodding which are recognized using a Dynamic Time Warping approach based on gesture specific features computed from depth maps. A static gesture consisting in pointing at an object is also recognized. The pointed location is then estimated in order to detect candidate objects the user may refer to. When the pointed object is unclear for the robot, a disambiguation procedure by means of either a verbal or gestural dialogue is performed. This skill would lead to the robot picking an object in behalf of the user, which could present difficulties to do it by itself. The overall system - which is composed by a NAO and Wifibot robots, a KinectTM v2 sensor and two laptops - is firstly evaluated in a structured lab setup. Then, a broad set of user tests has been completed, which allows to assess correct performance in terms of recognition rates, easiness of use and response times.},

  abstract  = {The identification of visual cues in facial images has been widely explored in the broad area of computer vision. However theoretical analyses are often not transformed into widespread assistive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems, due to factors such as inconsistent robustness, low efficiency, large computational expense or strong dependence on complex hardware. We present a novel gender recognition algorithm, a modular eye centre localisation approach and a gaze gesture recognition method, aiming to escalate the intelligence, adaptability and interactivity of HCI systems by combining demographic data (gender) and behavioural data (gaze) to enable development of a range of real-world assistive-technology applications.The gender recognition algorithm utilises Fisher Vectors as facial features which are encoded from low-level local features in facial images. We experimented with four types of low-level features: greyscale values, Local Binary Patterns (LBP), LBP histograms and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). The corresponding Fisher Vectors were classified using a linear Support Vector Machine. The algorithm has been tested on the FERET database, the LFW database and the FRGCv2 database, yielding 97.7{\{}{\%}{\}}, 92.5{\{}{\%}{\}} and 96.7{\{}{\%}{\}} accuracy respectively.The eye centre localisation algorithm has a modular approach, following a coarse-to-fine, global-to-regional scheme and utilising isophote and gradient features. A Selective Oriented Gradient filter has been specifically designed to detect and remove strong gradients from eyebrows, eye corners and self-shadows (which sabotage most eye centre localisation methods). The trajectories of the eye centres are then defined as gaze gestures for active HCI. The eye centre localisation algorithm has been compared with 10 other state-of-the-art algorithms with similar functionality and has outperformed them in terms of accuracy while maintaining excellent real-time performance.The above methods have been employed for development of a data recovery system that can be employed for implementation of advanced assistive technology tools. The high accuracy, reliability and real-time performance achieved for attention monitoring, gaze gesture control and recovery of demographic data, can enable the advanced human-robot interaction that is needed for developing systems that can provide assistance with everyday actions, thereby improving the quality of life for the elderly and/or disabled.},

Several obstacles in design and control must be overcome to cater for expected industry demands that push the boundaries of existing quadrotor performance. The X-4 Flyer, a 4. kg quadrotor with a 1. kg payload, is intended to be prototypical of useful commercial quadrotors. The custom-built craft uses tuned plant dynamics with an onboard embedded attitude controller to stabilise flight. Independent linear SISO controllers were designed to regulate flyer attitude. The performance of the system is demonstrated in indoor and outdoor flight. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is non-intrusive in that it only starts interaction with a user when it detects the user's intention to do so. All the robot's actions are based on multi-modal perceptions which include user detection based on RGB-D data, user's intention-for-interaction detection with RGB-D and audio data, and communication via user distance mediated speech recognition. The utilization of multi-modal cues in different parts of the robotic activity paves the way to successful robotic runs (94{\{}{\%}{\}} success rate). Each presented perceptual component is systematically evaluated using appropriate dataset and evaluation metrics. Finally the complete system is fully integrated on the PR2 robotic platform and validated through system sanity check runs and user studies with the help of 17 volunteer elderly participants.},
