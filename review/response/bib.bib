  abstract = {An empirical study that compared six different feedback cue types to enhance pointing efficiency in deictic spatial audio displays is presented. Participants were asked to select a sound using a physical pointing gesture, with the help of a loudness cue, a tim- bre cue and an orientation update cue as well as with combina- tions of these cues. Display content was varied systematically to investigate the effect of increasing display population. Speed, accuracy and throughput ratings are provided as well as effective target widths that allow for minimal error rates. The results showed direct pointing to be the most efficient interaction tech- nique; however large effective target widths reduce the applicabil- ity of this technique. Movement-coupled cues were found to sig- nificantly reduce display element size, but resulted in slower in- teraction and were affected by display content due to the require- ment of continuous target attainment. The results show that, with appropriate design, it is possible to overcome interaction uncer- tainty and provide solutions that are effective in mobile human computer interaction.},
